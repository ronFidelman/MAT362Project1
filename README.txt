To use this project, run executable. 

Use WASD keys to move. Observe particles varying speed depending on distance from
each other and from player. The fuzzy system attempts to keep the particles in
balance as the player moves. 

The system has cannot act as easily as the player does, hence why you can 
see an imbalance when you move the object. 

The source code files that implement this project are:

Antecedents.cs
CharacterController.cs
FiringRules.cs
FuzzyInference.cs
FuzzyNumber.cs
